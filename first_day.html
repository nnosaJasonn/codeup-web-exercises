            <p>There it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.
            </p>
            <p>Just make a decision and let it go. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Poor old tree. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?
            </p>
            <p>There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Use your imagination, let it go. See there how easy that is. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light.
